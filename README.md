A simplistic sensor base board for BME688 air quality sensor by Bosch Sensortec

The design allows for V<sub>CC</sub> and logic levels between 3V3 and 5V DC.

Due to the fact that the BME688 sensor features an LGA footprints with all pads below the sensor, manual soldering with a soldering iron is not possible for the sensor itself. All other parts can be soldered by hand, even though the 0402 components require a steady hand. Either way reflow soldering makes life a lot easier, if you keep the airflow low enough to not blow away your components. :wink:
